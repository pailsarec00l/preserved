# Welcome!
If you have no idea what this is, its for all the things that may or already have been deleted. I will put cool things here that should be perserved and kept so it isn't lost to history. I could also make this some sort of cool ultimate file storage thing which would be pretty cool. You can always save these on the wayback machine. (if i knew how, i don't even know if you can) 
First Edit: Why not, i have no idea when, but the eaglercraft repository was just taken down. Thankfully, when i made this i saved the file here, so this place actually has a purpose lol
